# Changing r_chunks global settings 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


```

Sourcing the boostrap file and change the global paramters


```{r loadbootstrap}
suppressMessages(source('bootstrap.R'))
suppressMessages(source('helperfunctions.R'))
```

# Exploratory data analysis


```{r dimension analysis}
dim(AirBNB)
dim(ZillowData)

```

We see that AirBNB has 95 dimensions with 40753 observations and Zillow has 262 dimensions with 8946 observations.


##Exploring AIRBNB data

Let's us look at the data first. The metadata is also available in the docx document

```{r viewdata ,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

# Looking at the first 90 columns 
out_table <- cbind(names(AirBNB)[1:30],names(AirBNB)[31:60],names(AirBNB)[61:90])
htmlTable(out_table,
          cgroup = c("Set 1:30", "Set 31:60","Set 61:90"),
          n.cgroup = c(3),
          rnames = FALSE)


```


Data type read from csv while loading
Reading a single row to understand the dataset

Price and other columns associated with money are listed in dollars. For example $50. In order to do analysis we will be stripping the dollar sign off of the entire column 


```{r columntypes}

#stripping the dollar sign off


#identify which columns needs stripping
remove_dollar<-strip_money(pattern = 'price',dataset = AirBNB)

#manually inspecting
colnames(zero_bedrooms[zero_bedrooms %>% str_detect(pattern = '\\$')])
additional_columns<-c('security_deposit','cleaning_fee','extra_people')

remove_dollar<-c(remove_dollar,additional_columns)
#strip dollar amount from these columns
AirBNB[,remove_dollar]<-apply(AirBNB[,remove_dollar],2,FUN = remove_sign,money = "\\$")



unique(lapply(AirBNB,class))

```

4 types of data were read : integer, character, numeric, logical 

Since we loaded the data with the option string as Factors =FALSE. We will have to do some data manipulation to understand the right data type 


URL columns would not be useful therefore removing these columns 

```{r removeurlcolumns}
AirBNB<-removethesecolumns(pattern_remove = "url",dataset = AirBNB)
AirBNB<-removethesecolumns(pattern_remove = "scrape",dataset = AirBNB)

```


What columns have NA values 


```{r NAs}

noofNA<-function(column){
  sum(is.na(column))
}

how_many_NA<-apply(AirBNB, 2,noofNA )
missing_values<-how_many_NA[how_many_NA>0]
kable(x = missing_values,caption = "Missing value analysis")
AirBNB<-AirBNB %>% select(-c('license','has_availability'))

```

Since we will be matching on location ,let us check the data integrity of zipcodes and latitude and longitude

1) zipcode should be of length 5
2) There are 618 rows which have improper length zipcodes. 

We can use latitudes and longtitudes for those locations and compare it with others but we will deal with it later


```{r}

sum(str_count(AirBNB$zipcode,pattern = "[0-9]")==5)
nrow(AirBNB)-sum(str_count(AirBNB$zipcode,pattern = "[0-9]")==5)

```


We see that there are 2 columns which have no values at all. We can delete those columns. 
As a rule of thumb we can safely remove columns which have missing values in ~[80]% of the rows


There are columns which are disseminating no information. Let us analyze columns for unique values

```{r delete_no_information}

apply(AirBNB,2,analyze_distinct_values)
AirBNB<-AirBNB %>% select(-c('requires_license','experiences_offered'))
```

From distinct value analysis we see that requires_license and experiences_offered have no information at all 


The consultancy company has already identified that 2 bedroom properties are the most profitable. 

Bedrooms is the variable we are filtering on for now, although later in the analysis we will try to include bedrooms of size 0 

```{r filter_2_rooms}

two_room_property<-AirBNB %>% filter(AirBNB$bedrooms ==2)

str(two_room_property)

```



If time permits I would like to check which kind of property is most suitable

```{r bedrooms}
class(AirBNB$bedrooms)
# let us see the distribution of the variable
table(AirBNB$bedrooms)
percentage_missing<-(sum(is.na(AirBNB$bedrooms))/nrow(AirBNB))*100

zero_bedrooms<-AirBNB[AirBNB$bedrooms==0,]


```

We observer two things 

1) 69 missing values or 0.17%
2) frequency distribution shows that there are 3525 properties which are having 0 bedrooms.
We will have to investigate this as to what kind of properties are they.


We will only look at those properties which are 2 bedrooms

Since 0 bedrooms can be a field which the user didn't enter or can be bad data


#Fixing bedrooms with zero length 



```{r fix_0_bedrooms}

ggplot(data = zero_bedrooms,mapping=aes(zero_bedrooms$beds,fill=zero_bedrooms$property_type))+
geom_histogram()+
scale_x_continuous(breaks = zero_bedrooms$beds)

  
```

Most of the data is for 1,2 and 3 beds

```{r price_analysis}


p<-ggplot(data=zero_bedrooms %>% filter(beds<4),mapping = aes(zero_bedrooms$price))+
geom_histogram(stat = 'count')

# p+facet_grid(vars(beds))

```
