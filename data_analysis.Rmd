# Changing r_chunks global settings 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


```

Sourcing the boostrap file and change the global paramters


```{r loadbootstrap}
suppressMessages(source('bootstrap.R'))
suppressMessages(source('helperfunctions.R'))
```

# Exploratory data analysis


```{r dimension analysis}
dim(AirBNB)
dim(ZillowData)

```

We see that AirBNB has 95 dimensions with 40753 observations and Zillow has 262 dimensions with 8946 observations.


##Exploring AIRBNB data

Let's us look at the data first. The metadata is also available in the docx document

```{r viewdata ,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

# Looking at the first 90 columns 
out_table <- cbind(names(AirBNB)[1:30],names(AirBNB)[31:60],names(AirBNB)[61:90])
htmlTable(out_table,
          cgroup = c("Set 1:30", "Set 31:60","Set 61:90"),
          n.cgroup = c(3),
          rnames = FALSE)


```


Data type read from csv while loading
Reading a single row to understand the dataset 

```{r columntypes}

unique(lapply(AirBNB,class))

```

4 types of data were read : integer, character, numeric, logical 

Since we loaded the data with the option string as Factors =FALSE. We will have to do some data manipulation to understand the right data type 


URL columns would not be useful therefore removing these columns 

```{r removeurlcolumns}
AirBNB<-removethesecolumns(pattern_remove = "url",dataset = AirBNB)
AirBNB<-removethesecolumns(pattern_remove = "scrape",dataset = AirBNB)

```


What columns have NA values 


```{r NAs}

noofNA<-function(column){
  sum(is.na(column))
}

how_many_NA<-apply(AirBNB, 2,noofNA )



```


We see that there are 2 columns which have no values at all. We can delete those columns. 
As a rule of thumb we can safely remove columns which have missing values in ~[80]% of the rows

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
